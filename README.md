# Empirical_Exercises

This repo contains the short article as a demostration of my empirical skills which I have been self learning over the pass few months. The assoicated [Stata](https://github.com/hazelchui/Empirical_Exercises/blob/main/Stata%20Code.do)and [R] (https://github.com/hazelchui/Empirical_Exercises/blob/main/R%20Code.R) code are also here. There are 2 sections in the article: 

#### 1. Fixed Effects Regressions – Relationship between Marriage and Wages for Females

I perform some fixed effects regressions using Stata and R in this exercise, which examines the effects of marriage on wages for women by using panel data of National Longitudinal Surveys from 1968 to 1988. Estimating five models (pooled ordinary least square, individual fixed effects, two-way fixed effects, individual fixed effects and two-way fixed effects with additional control on industry codes), I consistently demonstrate that a negative wage gap for married women exists. That is, married women in general earn less than their unmarried counterparts.  

#### 2. Difference in Differences – Effects of Training Subsidies on Job Trainings

I perform a difference in differences estimation using Stata and R in this section, studying the treatment effects of training subsidies on the number of job training hours provided by firms. Using a panel dataset of 157 Michigan firms in 1987-1989, I estimate the desired treatment effects using a DiD design. The results show that subsidies significantly increase the number of training hours offered to employees.
